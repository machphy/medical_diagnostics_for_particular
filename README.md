X-ray Diagnosis Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing X-ray images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask-based web application for real-time diagnosis using trained models.

Components
1. Dataset
The chest_xray directory contains three subdirectories (train, val, test) for training, validation, and testing datasets respectively.

2. Data Preprocessing (data_preprocessing.py)
This script preprocesses the X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

3. Model Training (train_model.py)
The train_model.py script defines and trains a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras on the preprocessed data. The trained model is saved as xray_diagnosis_model.h5.

4. Flask Web Application (app.py)
app.py serves as the main Flask application. It handles:

Uploading X-ray images from users (uploads directory).
Processing uploaded images using the trained model.
Rendering results (result.html) dynamically.
5. Templates (templates/)
index.html: Landing page with a form for uploading X-ray images.
result.html: Page displaying diagnosis results.
template.html: Basic template for other pages (if needed).
6. Static Files (static/)
styles.css: CSS styles for templates.
script.js: JavaScript for client-side functionality (if any).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/machphy/medical_diagnostics_for_particular
cd xray_diagnosis_project
Install dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

Copy code
python app.py
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the application.

Usage
Upload an X-ray image via the homepage.
Click "Diagnose" to process the image.
View the diagnosis result on the result page.
Notes
Ensure sufficient permissions and dependencies are installed (requirements.txt).
Adjust paths and configurations (app.py, data_preprocessing.py, etc.) as per your environment.
