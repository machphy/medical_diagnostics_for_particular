X-ray Diagnosis Project

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing X-ray images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask-based web application for real-time diagnosis using trained models.

Components

Dataset



The chest_xray directory contains subdirectories (train, val, test) for training, 
validation, and testing datasets.

Data Preprocessing (data_preprocessing.py)



This script preprocesses X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and 
augmentation.

Model Training (train_model.py)



Defines and trains a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras on preprocessed 
data. The trained model is saved as xray_diagnosis_model.h5.

Flask Web Application (app.py)



Main Flask application handling:

Uploading X-ray images (uploads directory).

Processing uploaded images using the trained model.

Dynamically rendering results (result.html).

Templates (templates/)



index.html: Landing page with an upload form for X-ray images.

result.html: Displays diagnosis results.

template.html: Basic template for additional pages if needed.

Static Files (static/)



styles.css: CSS styles for templates.

script.js: JavaScript for client-side functionality if required.

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:



bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/machphy/medical_diagnostics_for_particular

cd xray_diagnosis_project

Install dependencies:



bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask application:



bash

Copy code

python app.py

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the application.





Usage

Upload an X-ray image via the homepage.

Click "Diagnose" to process the image.

View the diagnosis result on the result page.

Notes

Ensure sufficient permissions and dependencies are installed (requirements.txt).

Adjust paths and configurations (app.py, data_preprocessing.py, etc.) as per your 
environment.
